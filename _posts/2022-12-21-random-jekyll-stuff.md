This page will just contain some Jekyll stuff. <br>
```rust
let mut hello = "Hi!!";
hello = "Hello";
println!("{}", hello);
```
Not a very useful script (and I think I added too many semicolons); but it is cool having the syntax highlighting.<br>
Also notices exist!<br>
An info notice! Wow, kinda cool {: .notice--info}
Warning notice, spooky {: .notice--warning}

Well guess that's all... for now. Guess there was less than I thought there was.
