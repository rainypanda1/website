Hello! Welcome to my website. I made this website because I like websites and computers in general, and wanted to try out Jekyll. 
This is a website made for fun, and doesn't really serve a purpose but I might add things to it.
<br><br>
This website uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. It is hosted on [github pages](pages.github.io) and uses [utterance](https://github.com/utterance) for its commenting system. It's a place I'll probably use to test various Jekyll plugins. I'm mainly going to store projects at [codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/RainyPanda) but their pages don't build the same way, making it difficult to host a website using Jekyll. I decided that out of all the options, GitHub was the best for this website.
<br><br>
It might also be cool as kind of a digital time capsule. Future me can see what I was writing about years before and that might be fun. I enjoy looking back at old projects and seeing improvements and judging the me of the past.
<br><br>
This website could contain things like:
* Origami instructions
* Other projects
* Recipes?
* Photos
* Random instruction things that I find helpful
  * For stuff like git commands that I tend to always forget

Basically, websites are fun and I want an excuse to have and update one.
