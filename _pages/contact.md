Again, I don't plan on anyone finding this website because it's not being used anywhere but thought I'd add a contact page because it makes the website feel more complete.

Matrix is convinient [@cloudpanda:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@cloudpanda:matrix.org). And of course [email](mailto:cloudpanda1@proton.me) exists too. 
[Keyoxide](https://keyoxide.org/E26A0672489D142A717D7F90D6C8C6E046932AB3) also lists some accounts and has verification linked with them. (Yay PGP signitures).
